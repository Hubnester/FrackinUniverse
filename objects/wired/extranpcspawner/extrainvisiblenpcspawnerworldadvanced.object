If the number is above (speciesuncommonrarity), it picks a species from the (npcSpeciesCommon) list. If it is below (speciesuncommonrarity) but above (speciesrarerarity) it will pick from the (npcSpeciesUncommon) list. If the chosen number is equal to or below (speciesrarerarity), it will pick a species from the (npcSpeciesRare) list.
