  ----------------------------------------------
  ^cyan;6.0.153 ^reset;

  ^orange;-- Weapon Shuffler ^green;(NEW!)^reset;^orange; --^reset;
    - takes one upgrade module and an RNG item (weapons, primarily) and will make another with the same level and base item, but a new seed and stats.
    - unlocked alongside matter converter, which is used to make it.

  ^cyan;-- Shrine of Souls --^reset;
  * it is now a crafting interface
  * moved crystal skull to shrine, and its unlock to the same node. you will have to pick one up from the tenebhrae at the science outpost to get this started.
  * added the advanced erchius buddies to the shrine, unlocked via madness, requiring an erchius shard (the augment), dark and red matter.

  ^yellow;-- Bows --^reset;
  * draw time reductions can no longer bring draw time to negative values, breaking the script and damage calculations
  * draw time reductions no longer reduce damage values to miniscule numbers
  * quivers' raw damage increases are no longer a hard override, and instead an additive number
  * flat value draw time reductions changed to draw speed increases, similar in principle to a fire rate increase.
  * All of the above means: bows now hit harder, but are somewhat slower than before.
  * Carnage Bow homing adjusted: prioritizes targets that are aggressive.
  * Carnage Bow : arrows should now properly face the direction they are flying
  * Carnage Bow: :onger indefinitely bounce off certain enemies for the projectile's lifetime, and are limited to 3 hits
  * Carnage Bow: homing control force reduced from 3x initial speed to 2x
  * Carnage Bow: arrows will now lose homing properties if stationary or colliding for more than a tenth of a second, so they can no longer be used as auto-targetting mines.

  ^green;-- Misc --^reset;
  * added orange and blue variants of 'void storage' images. the blue one is now used by the weapon compressor.
  * adds Zombie race Support
  * added an admin only option in sail's misc menu to clear all persistent and ephemeral effects, for debug purposes.

  ^#e43774;-- Bugs --^reset;
  * fixed a logic failure in superdark.lua
  * fixed an error in resourceconvert.lua when resources go negative via status effects.
  * unknown worlds now can roll 'airless' and 'super dark' effects. They will be re-randomized on next visit.
  * corrected a mistake in crucible code which prevented transmutation matrices from functioning.
  * gunfire/gunfirefixed: NPCs no longer have forced reload on weapon swap, unless the magazine was actually empty, to prevent annoying spammy reload issues -especially- with crew.
  * corrected LMH fuel value tooltip (to 32, rather than old value of 70)
  * increased element count cutoff threshold to 250, in fuweaponupgrade and fu_multiupgrade. this will address being unable to upgrade multidetectors
  * fixed a botched fix in radioactiveplant

	"welcome" : "Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
